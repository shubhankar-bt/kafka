We suggest you to please test the LDAP integration of the application with AD UAT environment :

ADS LDAP integration should be done by respective Application Owner by creating their own code 
(PHP, JAVA etc.) depending upon application platform. ADS team will provide AD related 
Information. AD provides authentication, authorization needs to be happened in application.
AO need to provide Application background & flow of application with ADS team. AO should first 
integrate application with UAT AD environment. Post that AD integration can be done for Production 
AD environment.
Please find below necessary information related to UAT AD Environment.
Pre-requisites:
AO should raise a FAR for connectivity with UAT ADS servers to open the required ports. For e.g. for 
secure LDAP port 636 needs to be opened. Once FAR is implemented connectivity can be tested by 
below Telnet command.
Telnet 10.189.42.83 636
Note - 10.189.42.83 is IP address of UAT AD server
UAT Servers Details:
FQDN for AD UAT server Domain Name IP Address
UATROOTDC1.UATAD.SBI UATAD.SBI 10.189.42.83
UATAHMDC1.ahm.UATAD.SBI AHM.UATAD.SBI 10.189.42.84
UATMUMDC1.MUM.UATAD.SBI MUM.UATAD.SBI 10.189.42.85
Note - Depending upon Application flow, ports need to be opened for root server or child server & 
respective certificate will be required for secure connection.
