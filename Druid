So Aditya and me are looking for alternate approach . Recently CBS has modified the sequence of sending control file and to leverage it we are ingesting the data into datalake using sprak streaming. This will save our file processing time that we had in earlier approach.  (Dev in progress)
 
So now all of our data will be available in data lake. So we can use it to share with Druid it has some plugin to use data lake. and this will be faster too. (yet to develop)
