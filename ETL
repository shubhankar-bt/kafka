Dear AD Team,
Following our discussion regarding the LDAP integration for [Your Application Name], we are proceeding with the implementation to support users across the entire forest (Root UATAD.SBI as well as Child domains like MUM / AHM).
To finalize our configuration and FAR request, we require clarification on the following technical points:
1. Service Account (Bind User) - Critical
Since anonymous searching is not supported for multi-domain lookups, we require a Service Account to perform the initial directory search.
• Request: Please create/provide the Distinguished Name (DN) and Password for this application bind user.
• Permissions: Please confirm this account has Read access to the Global Catalog (Port 3269) to search users across all child domains.
2. Port & Connectivity
We are updating our Firewall Access Request (FAR) to include Port 3269 (Global Catalog over SSL).
• Clarification: Can you confirm that connecting only to the Root IP (10.189.42.83) on Port 3269 is sufficient to authenticate users from child domains (e.g., Mumbai/Ahmedabad)? Or do we need connectivity to individual child DC IPs as well?
3. User Login Format (UPN Suffix)
Our application captures the User ID (e.g., 1015698).
• Clarification: When binding/authenticating a user from a child region (e.g., Mumbai), should we append the root suffix (e.g., 1015698@UATAD.SBI) for everyone? Or does the Global Catalog require the specific child suffix (e.g., 1015698@MUM.UATAD.SBI)?
4. SSL Certificate
We currently hold the certificate for UATAD.SBI (Root).
• Clarification: Does this same certificate cover the Global Catalog connection on Port 3269, or is there a separate certificate we need to import?
5. Base DN Scope
• Clarification: For searching users across the forest, should we set our Search Base DN to DC=UATAD,DC=SBI, or is there a specific root context for the Global Catalog?
Please provide these details so we can complete the development and testing phase.
