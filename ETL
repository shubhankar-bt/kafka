Subject: Clarification & FAR Status for LDAP Integration - [Your Application Name]
Hi AD Support Team,
We are in the process of integrating our application with the UAT AD environment. We have reviewed the provided server details and have a few technical queries to ensure our configuration is correct before the Firewall (FAR) is opened.
1. Authentication Point:
We are configuring our application to point to the Root DC (10.189.42.83).
• Query: Will this Root DC authenticate users from child domains (e.g., MUM/AHM) as well?
2. Principal Suffix:
Our application currently binds using the format userID@UATAD.SBI.
• Query: If a user belongs to the Mumbai region, will authentication work with @UATAD.SBI, or do we need to dynamically change the suffix to @MUM.UATAD.SBI?
3. FAR Status:
We have raised the FAR for Source [Your App IP] -> Destination 10.189.42.83:636.
• Status Check: Could you please confirm the ETA for this implementation? We cannot verify our code until Telnet to port 636 is successful.
Regards,
[Your Name]
