ETA recommendations :

Set appropriate timeouts for both the API call and the database query. Ensure robust error

handling for scenarios where the API or database fails
 
Use JSON-format logging for structured logs, capturing request metadata (e.g., timestamps, IP

addresses, and response times) and error details
 
Provide structured error messages with error codes, descriptions, and potential solutions.

Avoid disclosing sensitive system information.
 
Implement retry strategies for transient failures, ensuring that temporary outages do not

disrupt the dealer on boarding and renewal process
 


Please ensure FINCORE to maintain

full audit trails of login, file

processing, parameter level changes,

user level changes.
 
Please use logging of request/response

with encrypted PII data
 
Ensure, PII sensitive data must be

encrypted, encryption for data at rest,

data in use/motion. Enable Payload and

Chanel Encryption.
