Step 3: Import the UAT Certificate
The AD Team said: "additionally you need to import this UAT certificate in .cer format".
 * Get the .cer file from them.
 * Run the keytool command to import it into your External Truststore (C:/fincore/secrets/ad-truststore.jks).
   keytool -import -alias uat-root-cert -file "path/to/uat-cert.cer" -keystore "C:/fincore/secrets/ad-truststore.jks" -storepass changeit
