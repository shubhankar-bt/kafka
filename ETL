Hi AD Team,
To ensure our application can authenticate users from any domain (Root UATAD.SBI as well as Child domains like MUM or AHM), we will proceed with the Global Catalog approach.
Requirements:
1. Port: We have requested Port 3269 (SSL Global Catalog) in our FAR.
2. Service Account: Please create/provide an Application Bind User (Service Account) credentials (DN and Password).
• Reason: Our application requires this account to perform an initial directory search to locate the user's Distinguished Name (DN) across the forest before attempting authentication. Anonymous binding does not support this search capability in our framework.
Please provide the credentials once created.
Regards,
[Your Name]
